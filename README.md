OpenVision
==========

OpenVisionLibrary : Version 0.0

A Open source platform for developement and learning of image processing and computer vision algorithms.
Focus will be to develope modular,object oriented approach and scalable architecture for computer vision application.

In the initial version a high level interface to opencv libraries will be developed and with time the opencv
interface will be replaced with sutiable alternatives.

OpenCv has a large repository but most of code is difficult to interpret due to lack of comments and no implementation detail
at all. This platform will focus on documentation of algorithms and implementation details so that 
it can also serve as a good learning platform.


Following Models are currently present in OpenVisionLibrary


1 > 1-D,2-D Histograms
2 > Mean shift tracking algorithm


some of the documentation can be found on blog : http:/pi-virtualworld@blogspot.com or PDF format documents
