This platform will focus on documentation of algorithms and implementation details so that \r\nit can also serve as a good learning platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing Models are currently present in OpenVisionLibrary\r\n\r\n\r\n1 > 1-D,2-D Histograms\r\n\r\n2 > Mean shift tracking algorithm\r\n\r\n\r\nsome of the documentation can be found on blog : http://pi-virtualworld@blogspot.com or PDF format documents \r\ncan be found at http://scribd.com/pi19404\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
